PyRestful
---------

pyRestful is an API to develop restful services in Tornado Web Server.

We made changes from the last version to improve it and make it more easy.

With this api you can develop services like:

GET: http://myserver.domain.com:8080/user/{id} 

or

POST: http://myserver.domain.com:8080/user

PyRestful implements the verbs get, post, put and delete.
